Hello Guys , in my HTML code I have clearly coded for creation of basic website which could be your portfolio. I wantedly coded the html file to be simple and clean so you could get an understanding of how 
the code get reacted and form structures in an website. I would strongly suggest to have a more attractive website as your portfolio which may have some graphical motions catchy CSS code for having better 
chance of a good impression on your skill set.This code is for beginners who find it hard understand the structural outputs in HTML.
